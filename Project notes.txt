Concept.Selective RFID bird tag reader. A listed tag allow a door to open.

Hardware:
Arduino UNO
RFID reader(SeeedStudio) https://www.seeedstudio.com/125Khz-RFID-module---UART-p-171.html
Adafruit Data Logger    https://www.adafruit.com/product/1141
EZDriver stepper motorboard  ROB-12779   https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12779



Data format:
 is a timestamp, date,time, tag# (no separating characters), T or F
20161129,84726, 0123456AA, T
Each read will have it's own line
We will likely end up using a .CSV file format so that they can easily import to Excel


At present, the UNO is running the Data Logger code  ForTheBirds/Write_Timestamp_to_SDcard.ino



Tasks:

1.Very RFID reader functionality. Use my code, ForTheBirds/Seed_RFID/Mike_s_125Khz_read/Mike_s_125Khz_read.ino
  The tags should work with the retangular antenna

2. Connect the data logger and RFID board and ensure they do not interfere with each other.

3. Read a tag, save it along with timestamp to the SDcard

4. Read incoming tag
   Lookup 'accepted' tag list, 
      If it is in the list fire LED and add 'T' to saved data line
      If not in the list DO NOT fire LED and add 'F' to data line

In that time I will build an EZdriver motor board to test with.

5. Replace the LED indicator with the motor drive code.

6. If time allows or for future consideration it would be nice to have a known motor position by either a shaft encoder but could be as simple as an optical interrupt switch.
We'd use something like this http://www.vinland.com/Opto-Interrupter.html and put it inline with a section of the motor drive system. When the light through the middle of it, it would mean the door is closed.
This would be useful as a startup routine as well as regular operation.
